## About the test

The final functionality of the solution must allow the user to manage and view all messages
of the users available in the tool.

### üí´ Installation and deployment

To download the repository, in Visual Studio, open a terminal and run the following command:

Ecommerce frontend:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/msalvatore82/prueba-tecnica.git
```

Next, you will need to download the external modules. To do this, perform the following command:

```
$ npm i
```

Then, start the React frontend.

```
$ npm start
```

Now you will be able to navigate through the interface

### üíª Technologies used

- HTML
- Sass
- Typescript
- React
- Redux
- React-Router
- NodeJS
- Axios
- Ant-Design
- Guards

### Origin

The test consists of designing, implementing and connecting a platform with "cards" for the
display of posts or comments made by a user. For this, we will use as an example
the free content offered by jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, and more specifically, the results
offered by the GET call from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts..

### ‚öîÔ∏è Objectives

Create a REST API that is capable of the following:
Code entirely in TypeScript.

- Typed without types any.
- Code in React
- Use of functional components
- Good indentation
- Do not use external libraries that perform the function described in the document. Whether
  allow those that are a means to achieve the final functionality. (A bookstore
  that provides a dropdown for the card would be allowed, a library that creates the
  full card no).

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Minimum components:

- Login
- Home
- User
- Header
- Post
- Footer

## üîú Future implementations

- Some views Responsive design.
- Bugging corrections
- Add edit to the products.
- Post, can be filtered by use
- Post can be deleted and edited
